			<p class="content-block">I have the privilege of working as a graphic designer for RISD’s Continuing Education office. One of my recent projects consisted of designing the banners for RISD’s Pre-College info day. The banners were printed and displayed around RISD’s campus. <br><br>
			The most challenging aspects of this series of banners were understanding how it fits into the newly developed Pre-College identity and how it will affect the overall RISD identity which is fluid and always changing. Since the program is for high schoolers, the designs and colors reflect a playful and more whimsical approach to an art college experience.</p>

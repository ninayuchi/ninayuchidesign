		<p>The process of tying a slip knot does not have any connotations or history; it is a purely function process that is used universally. Therefore, in making this video for Design Studio I, I decided to inject as much connotation and context as I could into this instructional video. After tying several of my own knots, I realized the number of times you loop the string/rope it is arbitrary. You technically only have to loop it once for the knot to form but you can also loop it a thousand times and it’ll still undo itself when you pull on either end. I then decided to explore this idea of intense arbitrariness, looking at Gaspar Noe’s opening sequence for Enter the Void as inspiration. The video shows you the steps of tying a slip knot with several loops until the end shows the knot being undone with a simple tug of one end. This video was made with Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro.</p>

		<p>I began this project for Typography I by reading, analyzing, and annotating the academic essay by Wen Huei Chou (<a href="http://readings.design/PDF/design-history-in-globalization.pdf">here</a>). The subject of the marginalization of East Asian design in design history resounded with me as I considered how the Westernization of design has affected contemporary Asian-American designers. In the publication I vertically set the title and my annotations, mimicking the way Chinese type is written and read. This was a process that led me to think about how the Westernization of design has disoriented even the way Asian-Americans perceive language. <br><br>
		The typeface I chose for the publication was Univers, which I researched and read about how it was created as a typeface for universal typographical needs. The irony of using this typeface in my publication was that the system Univers was designed for—Westernized, Swiss design—ignores the scope of design and places importance on only one standard.</p>

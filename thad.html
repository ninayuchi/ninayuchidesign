		<p>Working as a research and design assistant for the RISD art history department, I received the opportunity to design the department rebranding as it changed its name to the Department of “Theory and History of Art and Design” (THAD). With the constraints of keeping a clean, structural visual with a limited color palette of black, white, and red, I also had to take into consideration the previous branding identity and pay homage to it. Other responsibilites as a research and design assistant included designing the Redwood Contemporary Art Initiative logo for the Redwood Library in Newport. Design criteria included a representation of the library’s classical architecture and a link to RISD THAD’s visual identity.<br>Currently, I am working on restructuring the THAD website and creating printed posters for several upcoming lectures and events.</p>
